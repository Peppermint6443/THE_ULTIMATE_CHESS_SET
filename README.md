# THE_ULTIMATE_CHESS_SET


This is a git repository to be used for the SIOY competition, the project being a self-moving chess board, eventually with voice recognition, AI, wifi playing, board to board/phone/computer integration, and much, much more

Main system includes an electromagnet, controlled by a CoreXY 3D printer setup, and the brains behind everything is a Raspberry Pi 4, Series B (4 GB RAM)

Things to be figured out: capabilities of the electromagnet, piece recognition

To be added: how to use GitLab to edit and share code;
